_This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data_  
_This pattern can tremendously **decrease time complexity**_

[BINARY SEARCH](../../Search/binarySearch.js)  
Time complexity: O(logN)  
Given a sorted array of integer, write a function call search, that accepts a value to the function is lcated. If the value is not found, return -1.
