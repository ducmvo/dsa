## Break It Down
#### Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.   
---
*This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well*

```javascript
//Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

// alpha numeric character and lowercase

function charCount(str) {
    // make object to return at end
    // loop over string, for each char, 
        // if char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add 1 to count. 
        // if char is a number/letter AND is NOT a key in object add it and set value to 1.
        // if char is something else (space, period, etc.), don't do anything.

    // return object at end
}

```
